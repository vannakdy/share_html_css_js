        <label>The CCDO is run by international volunteers and paid local staff as a non-political, non-religious organization. We are a small NGO making a big impact by tackling many important community issues. Cambodian Community Dream Organization, Inc. was first founded in Cambodia in 2007 by American Jenni Lipa with the sole objective of building water wells. However, Jenni quickly realized that children hold the key to the country's future. She believes that kids deserve not only clean drinking water, but a good education, better nutrition, and improved health. Jenni spearheaded many new programs and initiatives and eventually registered Cambodian Community Dream Organization, Inc. as a US-based 501(C)3 not-for-profit tax-exempt charity (NGO) in February, 2009. After splitting from the original Cambodian partner in July 2013, she registered a new NGO in Cambodia under the name Cambodian Community Dream Organization.</label>
